## Overview
We have recreated Pokemon in processing.
Our main focus was on creating a movable player, map/setting with obstacles, NPCs, and Pokemon battles.
After we completed the fundamental parts of the game, we continued implementing more features, such as a menu button, an item bag, and a shop
where users can buy more items. We also created wild Pokemon and the ability to catch Pokemon with Pokeball items.
The Pokemon button within Menu was created so that the user can check their current Pokemon.
Our demo game features mechanics such as:

- Walking around a 2D Map
- Interacting with an NPC
- Pokemon battles against an NPC
- Pokemon battles against wild Pokemon (including ability to fight and catch them, as well as to run away)
- A Menu, which contain's the player's item bag and a display of the player's current Pokemon
- A shop to purchase more items

We created a Game manager, modes (default, battle, menu), UI system, player and NPC classes, and Pokemon.
We also have parent classes such as Monobehaviour for UI objects (dialogue boxes, buttons).
## Instructions
- Use the WASD keys to move the player.
- Use the mouse clicks to click buttons, such as on-screen buttons and Pokemon move buttons when battling.
- Press the space bar to move to next dialogue.
- Press the 'E' key to interact with NPCs when the player is facing in the direction of the NPC (the other red square on the screen)
- Click on the Battle button on the top left of the screen in order to go straight to battling without
talking to the NPC.
