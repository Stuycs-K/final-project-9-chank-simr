Project: Pokemon
## Overview
We have recreated Pokemon in processing. Our demo game features mechanics such as:

- Walking around a 2D Map
- Interacting with an NPC
- Pokemon battles against an NPC

We created a Game manager, modes (default, battle, menu), UI system, player and NPC classes, and Pokemon.
We also have parent classes such as Monobehaviour for UI objects (dialogue boxes, buttons).
## Instructions
- Use the WASD keys to move the player.
- Use the mouse clicks to click buttons, such as on-screen buttons and Pokemon move buttons when battling.
- Press the space bar to move to next dialogue.
- Press the 'E' key to interact with NPCs when the player is facing in the direction of the NPC (the other red square on the screen)
- Click on the Battle button on the top left of the screen in order to go straight to battling without
talking to the NPC.
