## Overview
We created a Game manager, modes (default, battle, menu), UI system, player and NPC classes, and Pokemon.
We also have parent classes such as Monobehaviour for UI objects (dialogue boxes, buttons).
## Instructions
Use the WASD keys to move the player.
Use the mouse clicks to click buttons, such as on-screen buttons and Pokemon move buttons when battling.
Press the space bar to move to next dialogue.
Press the 'E' key to interact with NPCs when the player is facing in the direction of the NPC (the other red square on the screen)
